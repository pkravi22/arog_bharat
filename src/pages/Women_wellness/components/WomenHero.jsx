          Striking a healthy balance of spiritual, mental, emotional, and
          physical wellbeing can feel complex and overwhelming for women.
          Nature's flows mean menstrual health and fluctuating hormonal activity
          in different stages of life need nurturing and support. Yoga, as a
          lifestyle choice, with online yoga classes, offers education,
          embodiment, and daily practices to help ground you in self-care. The
          release of tension helps to rebalance our system for healing and
          empowerment.
